#Spring Boot and Docker

Source code in this repo is to support my on line course for Docker and Spring Boot. 

You can learn more about my course [here](http://courses.springframework.guru).

The Repo contains the source code for the John Thompson's Udemy tutorial [docker for java developpers](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-for-java-developers/).<br>
The course is focused on **Section 5: DevOps - Automating Building of Docker Images**
